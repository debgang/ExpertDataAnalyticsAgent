# ExpertDataAnalyticsAgent
Based on langchain pandas agent this expert agent can solve any data analytics,summarization or visualization problem for natural lanuage inputs

# Design

## Pandas Agent: 
Used Langchain Pandas Agent for as agent for analyzing 
given dataset. This agent calls the Python agent under the hood, which 
executes LLM generated Python code.

## Intent Classifier 
Analyses the input query from user and classifies the 
task in hand for the agent to execute. Rephrases the prompt to the agent 
based on the intent generated from LLM.Notify user if intent is unknown 
or not applicable as a data analysis task.

## Report Builder :
Generates a detailed report from a set of query and 
response pairs which the agent has generated

# Model used

For evaluation of the project I have used Azure GPT 4O model.Following 
environment variables needs to be set to execute the model

AZURE_API_VERSION
AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT

However any llm can be used for this evaluation.Just provide own implementation of initialize_llm


# Environemnt setup

Install Python > 3 vesrion.
Install the following packages
1. pip install langchain
2. pip install langchain_experimental
3. pip install pandas
4. pip install matplotlib
5. pip install langchain_openai
6. pip install sns

Note : There might be dependency issues based on existing library versions in your environment.Need to analyze the fix errors while compiling. 

# Code
The project is coded using Python 3 using langchain and AzureOpenAI modules.
Following files(modules) are included in the package

1.dialog_flow_agent.py (Main dialog flow and entry point)
2.langchain_agent.py (Agent initialization and responses)
3.llm_helper.py (Additional llm helper methods)

Step to execute : python.exe dialog_flow_agent.py
